ViewModel Todolist

Let's android study Design pattern.

I believe the best way to Learn is by doing.

# Tech stacks

- Kotlin
- lifecycle
- room
- koin
- RxKotlin
- paging

# Model

- UI Independent
- Data + Logic

# ViewModel

- Binds view to model
- Interpreter
- Processes intent
- Modifies the model from intent fuction

# View

- Reflects the Model
- Stateless
- Data is always flowing from the Model to the View
- Calls Intent function
